# ❤️ Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease in patients using supervised machine learning algorithms. 
It uses a medical dataset and applies classification models including **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, and **Random Forest** to identify patients at risk.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains various medical attributes such as:

- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise-induced angina
- ST depression
- Target (1 = presence of heart disease, 0 = absence)

## ✅ Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on heart disease data.
- Train and compare multiple **classification algorithms**.
- Evaluate model performance using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **ROC-AUC**, and **confusion matrix**.
- Tune hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV**.
